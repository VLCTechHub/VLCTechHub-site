<p>What is QA Minds Europe?</p>
<p>QA Minds Europe is the extension of QA Minds Latin America, which is a company and a community with a wide and recognized testing background in Latin America. We are a network of specialists and professionals who spread their knowledge and share experiences related to software testing and quality assurance through different talks and events across Europe.</p>
<p>In addition to that, we help to keep different companies and individuals stay up to date in testing tools and techniques through high value trainings, and with this, we transform our students in excellent software testers. Our instructors and mentors are specialists in software testing who are daily practitioners in their jobs at some of the best digital companies in the world.</p>
<p>Why QA Minds Europe?</p>
<p>Quality is a task that remains pending in most companies, and in many cases there is not a clear philosophy regarding this matter. For this reason, we have decided to expand from Latin America to Europe, keeping the same collaborative spirit, sharing and offering knowledge and skills on this field.</p>
<p>Our goal is to offer different types of testing via several events and workshops throughout the year. We will focus our initial efforts on our launch event and three different workshops that we have built based on references and feedback from the testing community, always concentrated on delivering high value content to fulfill our attendant’s expectations.</p>
<p>Workshops</p>
<p>Initially, we will offer the following workshops:</p>
<p>September 30th: 09:00am - 17:00pm</p>
<p>October 1st: 09:00am - 17:00pm</p>
<p>Automation with Selenium - Andrew Krug (founder of Lazy Coder and Selenium expert)</p>
<p>Testing Mobile Apps with Appium - Jose Pita (experienced mobile automation engineer @ Wikimedia)</p>
<p>Simplifying and improving automated testing with Docker - Diego Molina (Selenium Committer, Software Engineer @ Sauce Labs)</p>
