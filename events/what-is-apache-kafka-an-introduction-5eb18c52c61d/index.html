<p>Speaker: Viktor Gamov, Developer Advocate, Confluent</p>
<p>Title: What is Apache Kafka?</p>
<p>Abstract:
Apache Kafka is an open source distributed streaming platform that allows you to build applications and process events as they occur. Viktor Gamov (developer Advocate at Confluent) walks through how it works and important underlying concepts. As a real-time, scalable, and durable system, Kafka can be used for fault-tolerant storage as well as for other use cases, such as stream processing, centralized data management, metrics, log aggregation, event sourcing, and more.</p>
<p>This talk will explain what a streaming platform such as Apache Kafka is and some of the use cases and design patterns around its use—including several examples of where it is solving real business problems.</p>
<p>Bio:
Viktor Gamov is a Developer Advocate at Confluent, the company that makes a streaming platform based on Apache Kafka. Working in the field, Viktor Gamov developed comprehensive expertise in building enterprise application architectures using open source technologies. He enjoys helping different organizations design and develop low latency, scalable and highly available distributed systems. He is a professional conference speaker on distributed systems, streaming data, JVM and DevOps topics, and is regular on events including JavaOne, Devoxx, OSCON, QCon, and others. He co-authored O’Reilly’s ‘Enterprise Web Development’.</p>
