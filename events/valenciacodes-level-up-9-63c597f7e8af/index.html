<p><strong>Going From GPT3 to ChatGPT</strong><br /><em>by Dave Sullivan, Founder @ Cadence Labs</em><br />ChatGPT is a neural network based chat interface that has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. In this talk, I will explain how ChatGPT's predecessor GPT3 works by introducing neural networks, transformers, and the dataset and training objectives used. Then I will explain how instructGPT was created through a 2 step finetuning process and then productized as chatGPT. I will discuss open source replication attempts, issues around scaling, and the difficulty of doing this at home as I go.</p>
<p><strong>Zero to Production in Go</strong><br /><em>by Danilo Delizia, Staff Software Engineer @ commercetools</em><br />In this talk, we will see how our team at commercetools has adopted Go as the main programming language for a microservice-based web application. With the premise that most of the team had no previous knowledge of Go, we will see how it was possible to have an entire team going from zero to production in less than one month. I will present to you the reasons why we decided to use Go, the tools and processes we used to make the development team productive in a short amount of time without compromising code quality.</p>
<p><strong>What is Level Up?</strong> It's a monthly meet-up where we will be inviting speakers from inside and outside of our community to introduce you to interesting technical topics and share their experiences with you.<br />Each talk will be between 20-25 minutes + 5 more minutes for Q&amp;A.</p>
