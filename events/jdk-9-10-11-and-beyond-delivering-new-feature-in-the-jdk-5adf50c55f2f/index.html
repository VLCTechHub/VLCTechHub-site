      <p>JDK 10 was released only six months after JDK 9, demonstrating that the new fast cadence for the OpenJDK works. Even with such a short development cycle, there were still over a hundred new features covering the language, core libraries and the JVM.</p>
<p>In this session we'll take a look at how the Java platform is evolving with the introduction of big features like the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) in JDK 9, local variable type inference in JDK 10 and dynamic class file constants in JDK 11. We'll also cover many of the smaller features that will make your life as a developer easier.</p>
<p>What might JDK 12, 13 and 14 include? To answer that question, we'll explore some of the longer-­‐‐term plans for Java, like project Amber, Loom and Valhalla.</p>
<p>The speaker will be Simon Ritter. Simon is the Deputy CTO of Azul Systems. He has been in the IT business since 1984 and holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from Brunel University in the U.K.</p>
<p>Simon joined Sun Microsystems in 1996 and started working with Java technology from JDK 1.0; he has spent time working in both Java development and consultancy. Having moved to Oracle as part of the Sun acquisition, he managed the Java Evangelism team for the core Java platform, Java for client applications and embedded Java. Now at Azul, he continues to help people understand Java as well as AzulÕs JVM technologies and products. Simon has twice been awarded Java Rockstar status at JavaOne and is a Java Champion. He currently represents Azul on the JCP Executive Committee and on the Java SE Expert Group (JSR 379, 383 and 384).</p>
